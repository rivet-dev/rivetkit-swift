# RivetKit Swift SDK (Mirror)

This repository is a mirror of the Swift client located in the main Rivet monorepo:
[rivet-dev/rivet](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/rivetkit-swift)

We mirror it here so Swift Package Manager can clone a small repo quickly instead of the full monorepo.

Please file all issues and pull requests on the monorepo.
